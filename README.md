# deep-learning-challenge

This repository models a neural network using data on donations from a foundation to different charitable organizations to predict which charities will succeed if they are given the funding. The dataset includes information on the financials of the organizations, the type of organization they are, and the amount they're asking for amongst other things. There are two notebooks in this repository, one containing the initial model and its training and the other containing attempts at optimizing it to reach an accuracy of 75%. Also included is a report on the process.
